# flink-client

This library provides a Java client for managing Apache Flink via the [Monitoring REST API](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/monitoring/rest_api.html).

The client is generated with [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) from an OpenAPI specification file.

## How to get the binaries

The library is available in Maven Central Repository, and GitHub.

If you are using Maven, add this dependency to your POM:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.nextbreakpoint</groupId>
        <artifactId>com.nextbreakpoint.flinkclient</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.4</version>
    </dependency>        

## How to generate the code

Generate the code from the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/nextbreakpoint/flink-client/blob/master/flink-openapi.yaml) using Maven:

    mvn clean compile

## How to build the library

Build the library using Maven:

    mvn clean package

## How to run the tests

Make sure you have Docker installed and create the required bridge network:

    docker network create flink-test 
 
Run the tests using Maven:

    mvn clean verify

## Documentation

Create the Flink client:

    FlinkApi api = new FlinkApi();

Configure host and port of the server:

    api.getApiClient().setBasePath("http://localhost:8081");

Configure socket timeouts:

    api.getApiClient().getHttpClient().setConnectTimeout(20000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    api.getApiClient().getHttpClient().setWriteTimeout(30000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
    api.getApiClient().getHttpClient().setReadTimeout(30000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)

Optionally enable debugging:

    api.getApiClient().setIsDebugging(true)

Get Flink cluster configuration:

    DashboardConfiguration config = api.showConfig();

Show list of uploaded jars:

    JarListInfo jars = api.listJars();

Upload a jar which contain a Flink job:

    JarUploadResponseBody result = api.uploadJar(new File("flink-job.jar"));

Run an uploaded jar which some arguments:

    JarRunResponseBody response = api.runJar("bf4afb3b-d662-435e-b465-5ddb40d68379_flink-job.jar", true, null, "--INPUT A --OUTPUT B", null, "your-main-class", null);

Get status of all jobs:

    JobIdsWithStatusOverview jobs = api.getJobs();

Get details of a job:

    JobDetailsInfo details = api.getJobDetails("f370f5421e5254eed8d6fc6673829c83");

Terminate a job:

    api.terminateJob("f370f5421e5254eed8d6fc6673829c83", "cancel");

For all the remaining operations see documentation of Monitoring REST API or see [OpenAPI specification file](https://github.com/nextbreakpoint/flink-client/blob/master/flink-openapi.yaml).

## Flink compatibility

The current version of the library has been tested against Flink 1.10.0, but the library is known to work with older versions.   
The library is compatible with Flink Monitoring REST API v1, which didn't change for long time (at least since Flink 1.7).
The library should be compatible with newer versions too, unless a breaking change is introduced in the Flink Monitoring REST API. 

## Known limitations

The library has integration tests with a code coverage of 90%. 
Few endpoints don't have tests and not all fields in the responses are currently verified.
